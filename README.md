#Description

This is an analysis of a nutrition dataset in python. I started by cleaning the dataset, then discovered the mean calorie count for food items containing certain keywords. Secondly, I extracted the mean amount of calories for food entries that included certain keywords. I created a new column "calorie level" that created bins of calorie counts into levels 1-4 using the minimum, maximum, and quartile values for calories. I created a new column "all vitamins" that added up the total vitamins for each food item. I performed Linear Regression on fat vs. calories, finding a 0.65 r^2 score between these variables. I performed Linear Regression on water vs. calories, finding a -0.81 r^2 score between these variables. I perfomed cross-validation on multiple Sci-Kit Learn Machine Learning models, choosing to use RandomForestClassifier. Lastly, I predicted calorie level from fat, carbohydrates, and protein at ~95% accuracy using RandomForestClassifier.
